# BerkeleyPractical_III
<br><br>
<p>
 In this Practical Application (III), my goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines (SVC). The dataset that we are working with is related to the marketing of bank products over the telephone. The dataset may be <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing" target="_blank">found here.</a>
 </p>
 <p>
The data is from a Portuguese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns.
  </p>
  <p>
  Within this Practical Application, I will deliver understanding of the business objectives, show the need for data preparation, and modeling. After which, I will demostrate a correct and concise interpretation of descriptive and inferential statistics. My findings, which will include actional insights, will be used to suggest next steps and recommendations.
