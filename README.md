The dataset that we are working with is related to the marketing of bank products over the telephone. The dataset may be <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing" target="_blank">found here.</a>

  <p>
  Within this Practical Application, I will deliver understanding of the business objectives, show the need for data preparation, and modeling. After which, I will demostrate a correct and concise interpretation of descriptive and inferential statistics. My findings, which will include actionable insights, will be used to suggest next steps and recommendations.
